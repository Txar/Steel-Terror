Steel Terror is a simple game about driving a tank and destroying other tanks with it. Rarely, in a Dungeon stronger, Golden Tanks appear, so be careful out there. The danger of an encounter with the Golden Tank can reward you with a pet or a new tank for you to use, if you survive, so good luck.
After defeating the Golden Tank, a reward unlocks in the shop.

The map is randomly generated every time so that every run feels at least a little different.

In the shop, golden locks can be unlocked only by defeating a Golden Tank, and the other ones (for colors) cost 20 bullets to unlock each.

Have fun and thanks for playing! <3
